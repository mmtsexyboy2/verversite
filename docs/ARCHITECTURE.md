# Architecture Document

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the high-level architecture for the project. It includes decisions on the technology stack, repository structure, and service communication patterns.

## 2. Technology Stack

*   **Backend Framework:** Python with Django.
    *   *Reasoning:* Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It comes with a powerful Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) and a built-in admin interface, which will be beneficial for the admin module.
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL.
    *   *Reasoning:* As per project requirements. PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source object-relational database system with a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance.
*   **API Style:** REST APIs.
    *   *Reasoning:* REST is a widely adopted standard for building web APIs. It's stateless, scalable, and well-supported by Django (e.g., via Django REST framework).

## 3. Repository Structure

*   **Monorepo:** A single repository will be used to house all backend code for this project.
    *   *Reasoning:* For the initial phase of the project, a monorepo simplifies dependency management, code sharing, and atomic commits across different parts of the application.

## 4. Service Communication

*   **Internal Communication:** Direct function/class calls within the Django monolith.
*   **External Communication (Clients/Frontend):** Services will expose RESTful APIs for client applications (e.g., web frontend, mobile apps) to consume.
