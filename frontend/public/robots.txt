Disallow: /admin/ # Placeholder for future admin panel paths
Disallow: /login # User-specific pages not valuable for crawling once logged in
Disallow: /profile # User-specific pages

# Sitemap: Replace YOUR_DOMAIN.COM with your actual production domain
# For local testing, this might point to localhost, but for production, it must be the live domain.
# Example: Sitemap: http://localhost:3000/sitemap.xml (for local dev, if NEXT_PUBLIC_FRONTEND_URL is http://localhost:3000)
# Production: Sitemap: https://www.verversite.com/sitemap.xml (replace with actual domain)
Sitemap: http://localhost:3000/sitemap.xml
# Note: The URL here should be the publicly accessible URL of your frontend.
# If process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FRONTEND_URL is available during build, it could be used.
# Otherwise, manually set for production.
