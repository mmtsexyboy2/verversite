NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3001
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL_SSR=http://localhost:3001 # For SSR fetches. In some Docker setups, this might be internal (e.g., http://backend:3001). For simplicity with local dev, localhost often works.

# Notes:
# - NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL is used by client-side code and should be the URL accessible by the user's browser.
# - NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL_SSR is used by getServerSideProps. If your Next.js app and backend run in different containers,
#   this might need to be the internal Docker network URL of your backend service (e.g., http://backend:3001).
#   If running Next.js locally and backend in Docker, http://localhost:3001 is usually correct for both.
# - Do not store any secrets in this file.
